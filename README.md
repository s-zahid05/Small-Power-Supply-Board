# Small-Power-Supply-Board
This is a small power supply PCB board that should take in 12V and turn it into 1.5 V, 1.8V, 3.3V, 2.5V and 1.2V. This is mostly a test circuit to ensure that the board is capable of producing a reliable source of these 4 voltages. In the gerber files, a testpad will be visible, this only so I can test the voltages.
